# Roku Component Library

## Installation

Follow these steps to prepare your channel to use RCL and its components:

* Copy the `RCL` folder into your channel so that the path to the folder is `pkg:/components/RCL`. _This path is required for certain graphic elements to work correctly._
* Copy `RCL.brs` into your channel so that the path to the file is `pkg:/source/RCL.brs`
* Add this line to your manifest: `bs_libs_required=roku_ads_lib`

You are now ready to use RCL in your channel!
