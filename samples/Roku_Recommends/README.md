# SGDEX Sample Channel

## Roku Recommends

This sample shows a complete channel driven by a single RSS feed.

### GridView

Primary content navigation in this sample uses a _hero_ style GridView.
Hero style uses larger posters on the top row of the grid.

### DetailView

Selecting a poster from the grid opens a DetailView for that piece of content.
The DetailView operates in list mode, so you can navigate left/right through the list of content using the d-pad on the remote.

### Video View

Selecting the _Play_ button on the DetailView opens a VideoView for that piece of content.
The VideoView operates in list mode without endcards, so the next video in the list will play immediately.
When the last video in the playlist finishes, the VideoView closes and the DetailView is displayed.
